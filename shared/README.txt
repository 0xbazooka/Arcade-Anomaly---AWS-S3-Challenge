Hey Nour,

Can you please run the PixelSync.ps1 script on the environment when you get a chance? It syncs the mod logs and uploads a compressed archive to the shared S3 bucket.

Let me know once it’s done and don’t forget to delete the script afterward, we don’t want its contents lingering around ;)

thanks
